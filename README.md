Project Brief

The City of Atlanta is in need of visually appealing ways to interact with 
and display performance data on its website - on both standard and mobile platforms.  This interaction and 
display should involve charts, graphs, and other forms of data visualization. 
This could take the form of a general City of Atlanta "dashboard" and/or  visualizations embedded on the 
respective pages of the City of Atlanta website. 
It is important to consider both the visual display of information and also how 
users will interact with this information.
